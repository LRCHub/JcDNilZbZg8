```
Future needs a big kiss
Winds blow with a twist
Never seen a move like this
Can you see it too
Night is falling everywhere
Rockets hit the funfair
Satan loves a bomb scare
But it won't scare you
Hey Sexy Boots
Get on your Boots
Free me from the dark dream
Candy bars ice cream
All the kids are screaming
but the ghosts arent real
Heres what you gotta be
Love & community
Laughter is eternity
if the joy is real
You dont know how beautiful
You dont know how beautiful
You are You don't know
You get it do you
You dont know
How beautiful you are
If someones into blowing up
Were into growing up
Women are the future
All the big revelations
Ive gotta submarine
Youve got gasoline
I dont wanna talk about wars
between nations Not right now
Sexy Boots
Get on your Boots
Yeah Foxy boots
You dont know how beautiful
You dont know how beautiful
You are You don't know
You get it do you
You dont know
How beautiful you are
You are Sexy Boots
I dont wanna talk about wars
Let me in the sound
Let me in the sound
Let me in the sound
Let me in the sound
Let me in the sound
Let me in the sound
Let me in the sound
My God Im going down
I dont wanna drown now
Let me in the sound
Let me in the sound
Let me in the sound
Let me in the sound
Let me in the sound
Let me in the sound
<♪>
Get on your Boots
Get on your Boots
Get on your Boots
Get on your Boots
